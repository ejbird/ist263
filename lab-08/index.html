            My name is Erik Bird. I am a sophomore information management and technology major at Syracuse University. I am interested in information security.<br>
            My interests outside of school include hiking, snowboarding, and woodworking.<br>
            I currently have a basic working knowledge of <strong>HTML and JavaScript</strong>, however, I look forward to learning more about front-end web development and building my skillset.
